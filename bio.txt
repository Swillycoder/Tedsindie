I live semi-offgrid in a cabin in Cornwall, UK. There are approximately 4 acres of land which consists of 2 Orchards, 3 Polytunnels and a Market Garden. Two days a week I work as a Kitchen Porter in a local restaurant and also work in their kitchen garden to try and grow as much produce for the restaurant as possible.
