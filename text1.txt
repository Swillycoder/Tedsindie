This website is constructed in HTML canvas. This means each page is a rendering and so you will not be able to copy and paste text or images. I decided to use this approach to web design as I also make mini-games in HTML canvas, so by extension I decided to make this website in canvas. I work in what is known as 'vanilla' JavaScript, which means everything I code is done from scratch. Have a go at my mini games and send feedback to my email. Enjoy. Teddy.x
